I run because I want to set a healthy example for my sons and family. I run because it motivates me in many other areas of my life. I run for the shirts, bibs, and medals. I run to keep strong and feel young. I run to break personal boundaries.

## Starting Running

I started running back in 2002\. I struggled off and on for years to find a rhythm because I kept experiencing knee pain after a few weeks. Then in 2008, while talking to my friend Richard about running, he mentioned that he only runs 3 days a week because it gives his body a break for a day or so allowing time to heal. He also mentioned that it's a good thing for your running shoes. That made a ton of sense to me.

## What Started My Passion for Running

Then in early 2009, Heidi and I found out that we were going to have our first child. The idea of being a father began to affect every facet of my life, including being active and taking care of myself. It became really important to me to set a positive example for my son. This got me motivated to start eating better, and ultimately start running consistently.

I began running 3 days a week giving myself a day or two to rest in between. I started out at about a mile and a half and focused on just getting through that without stopping, not worrying about time or pace. Then I shot for two miles and started pushing through without stopping. Then I moved up to 3 miles, and I thought it was one of the greatest things. I had always been a short distance sprinter when I was young and would hate running a mile. This change really had a profound impact on my beliefs of myself.

## Taking My Running to the Next Level

After I moved to Austin in 2013, I started working out with a local outdoor fitness group of Camp Gladiator. In that group I met one of my now closest friends, Eric. We worked out together and pushed each other trying to outdo one another. He and I got to talking about running and he invited me to come running with him around Ladybird Lake. He asked me how far I ran normally. I told him 3-4\. He said that if I could run that far, I could run 5\. I was apprehensive, but went along with it to see how I did. That first little push, was the beginning of my understanding of how break my own barriers. Some time later he asked me to run 7 miles with him and told me that if I could run 5, I could do 7\. Sure enough, I ran 7 miles and never had done anything like that before.

A few months of running like this, Eric asked me if I wanted to sign up for the Barundi race together. Going along for the ride like I normally do with Eric, I said sure why not. Then I realized the race was 10 miles and hadn't run that far yet. Eric and I did a couple 10 mile training runs around Ladybird working up to that. Race day was awesome. I had no idea the rush of adrenaline at the start of a race or the game of passing people in front of you, and most importantly pushing yourself that last leg to cross the finish line as strongly as you can. I will never forget it.

Now that I had the race bug, I started looking for other races coming up and decided that I would try a half marathon, because if I could run 10 miles, what was 13.1? The next race was Decker in the first part of December. Winter mornings in Texas are chilly and the start of Decker was no exception, 29Â° F. Oh, and I also found out first hand the endless hills and beast of a hill at mile 10 that make up Decker. It was a rush though crossing that finish line.

## Life's Ebs and Flows

Spring of 2014 Heidi and I bought a house in north Austin and moved the family up there. With the packing and moving I wasn't running regularly and had taken a little time off after racing THREE more half marathons. The weather was also starting to warm up. I had also gotten really skinny with all of my training that I decided to try an bulk up a bit. Those three things: weather warming up, taking a little time off, and putting some weight on had an adverse affect I hadn't expected; running slower. I had lost roughly a 2:00 minute pace. It devastated my motivation.

I would run from time to time knowing that I just needed to get back into a rhythm. The warm summer mornings kept getting warmer and my pace kept increasing in time. My motivation for running was going down the toilet. After many talks with Eric about this, I finally came to terms that my situation was different and that I needed to reset my expectations for how well I could run. Also that with consistent training I could get there again, in time.

That winter Heidi and I had our second child. Those of you with kids understand what having a newborn does to your life let alone your desire to run on a regular basis. I would see people running and day dream about myself running, something apparently a lot of runners do when they see someone running. I would catch a run every once in a while when I had gotten decent sleep but it was probably once every few weeks.

As things settled in a bit more with our second child, I was able to run more consistently but still not 2-3 days a week. I had also come to terms with being a 10:30 pace runner versus the 8:00 runner that I was. I just ran for the feeling of accomplishing something again. I ran for the rush. I ran for my sons. I ran for my sanity (running always seems to level me out).

## Chapter 3

By fall of 2015, my love for running was slowly coming back, but now forged in knowledge and experience. I knew it would take time, training and patience to achieve my long standing goal of a 90 minute half marathon. I'll do the math for you, it's a 6:50 pace for 13.1 miles. My fastest average pace on a long run was 7:45, so I know it's within reach (be it a far one at this point). I would run 1-2 days a week for a few weeks at a time and then something would happen, boys would get sick, I would get sick, you know life.

I kept pushing. I was back to running 2-3 days a week consistently. Eric was telling me that I would be at 10:00 pace in 4-6 weeks. I did it in 3\. Then a month later I was at 9:30\. I was getting my fire and speed back.

I was also listening to a lot of personal development books and had started reading and doing my Miracle Mornings again, which I highly recommend you read the book if you haven't already. I also stopped running with music and headphones and stared listing to nature and my breathing. I also began reciting affirmations while a ran and working out things in my mind. I became more mindful of the run itself and focusing on my form and visualizing that 6:50 pace.

That brings us to today. I run 2-3 days a week. I am starting back with my Run Less, Run Faster training program. I cross train with cycling, yoga and some P90X. My goal is to complete that 90 minute half marathon this winter. I am also signed up with Eric and some running buddies to complete a running relay of 233 miles over the course of two days.

This is why I run. I love it. It motivates me in so many ways and I find it so rewarding.
